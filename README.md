# chauffeur-tracker-service Documentation

A Restful API web service that enables busy people to manage their weekly driving responsibilities and schedule drop-offs and collections. You can track when and where you want to go, and at what time to pick up your family.

This *mock* API is designed to simulate the REST interface of an imaginary service.

## Documentation

For the REST API docs, see The Chauffeur Tracker Service documentation. This is a GitHub Pages site, which is configured in the context of the repo settings.
