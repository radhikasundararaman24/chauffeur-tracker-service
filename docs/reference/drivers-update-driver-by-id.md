# Update a specific driver

Updates a [`drivers`](drivers) object in the database.

For example, you want to update properties of *driverId=4* in the database.

Assumption: to update the correct driver, you must know the `driverId` to query.

The request body contains the updated driver's details.

## URL

```shell

{PUT}{server_url}/drivers/{id}
```

## Query parameters

| Property | Description | Type | Required | Notes |
| -------------- | ------ | ------------ |------------ |------------ |
| `driverId` | The record ID of the driver to return.  | number | Required |  |

---

**NOTE:**
{PUT} calls replace the [`drivers`](drivers) object. To update/replace single property instances in the [`drivers`](drivers) object, use a {PATCH} call in your [drivers request](drivers-update-driver-by-property.md).
