Returns an array of driving [`schedules`](schedules) objects for specified query parameters.

For example, to return drivers who are scheduled to drive *Molly*, query the property `passenger` to filter responses.

## URL

```shell

{GET}{server_url}/schedules/?{property}={value}
```

## Query parameters

Optionally, you can specify schedule properties as`Key/Value` query parameters. For example: `title/School run`. Note that property titles are case sensitive.

| Property | Description | Type | Required | Notes |
| -------------- | ------ | ------------ |------------ |------------ |
| `title` | The title or short description of the driving schedule. | number | Optional | Example: Vet visit, School run. |
